# Forecasting_Urban_Tree_Health_Trends
Using Machine Learning to take in past Project True Tree Data, my current Tree Data, and creating a predictive graph/chart of the possible trends of trees in certain areas in the Bronx Zoo.

Work in progress! Will include a front-end framework to display many graphs, not only ML models
